# Chaotix.AI Assignment

## Project Overview
Chaotix.AI Assignment is a Django-based application that utilizes Stability AI's Text-to-Image API to generate images asynchronously using Celery. The project is containerized using Docker and connects to a PostgreSQL database. The application also features a REST API built with Django REST Framework for managing TestUser objects.

## Features

1. **Image Generation:** Asynchronously generate images based on text prompts using Stability AIâ€™s Text-to-Image API.
2. **Celery Integration:** Manage asynchronous tasks with Celery and Redis.
3. **PostgreSQL Database:** Store image metadata and user information.
4. **Django REST Framework:** Provide a RESTful API for managing TestUser objects.
5. **Dockerized Environment:** Containerize the application using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
6. **Multi-Container Setup:** Use Docker Compose to manage multiple services (Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Pgadmin,       
   Celery).
